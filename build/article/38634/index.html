	<p class="leading-relaxed text-base"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>What makes Chicago one of the best cities in the world? To some, it&#8217;s the delectable food. For others, it’s the breathtaking skyline and lakefront. Depending on who you root for, it’s the sports. But here at the Obama Foundation, we believe it’s the people. The changemakers, young people, business owners, and community leaders who have pushed this broad-shouldered city forward throughout history.</p>
<p>On our continued <a href="https://www.obama.org/updates/road-to-groundbreaking-kickoff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Road to Groundbreaking</a> for the Obama Presidential Center, we’ve gotten to connect with even more of the amazing Chicagoans, particularly South Siders, who make this city as vibrant and engaged as it is.</p>
<p>Yesterday, President Obama got to meet a few of them!</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It’s great to be back in my hometown and even better to spend some time with talented young people in Jackson Park. I’m proud of the Wolfpack for a terrific season, and for their leadership off the field as well.

<p>After greeting players, President Obama answered a few of their questions and shared some words of encouragement, urging the Chicago youth to positively impact their communities and to keep going, even when times are tough.</p>
<p>From there, he continued his visit through the community that has given him and Mrs. Obama so much, stopping by a small gathering of local business owners at <a href="https://www.southshorebrewcoffee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">South Shore Brew</a>, a local coffee shop in the South Shore neighborhood of Chicago.</p>
<p>Obama Foundation President Valerie Jarrett joined Cheryl Gill, owner of <a href="https://www.dustemclean.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dust &#8216;Em Clean</a> Janitorial Services; Eric Williams, founder of Chicago institution and brand <a href="https://thesilverroom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Silver Room</a>; Donna Hampton Smith, Executive Director of the <a href="http://www.thewashingtonparkcofc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Park Chamber of Commerce</a>; Tonya Love Trice, founder and owner of <a href="https://www.slabbbq.com/">Slab BBQ</a> and Executive Director of the <a href="https://www.southshorechamberinc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">South Shore Chamber of Commerce</a>; and South Shore Brew owner Jennifer Barnes for an evening that started with a special conversation—and ended with a big surprise:</p>

<p>We’re thrilled President Obama could meet with some of the young people and business owners who will be impacted positively when the Center opens, and hear from them directly about their hopes for what the world-class museum, campus, and public spaces will offer.</p>
<p>None of this work would be possible without support and steady engagement from our local community, and we’re thankful for all of their input along the way. You can learn more about the Obama Presidential Center and its multitude of community resources <a href="http://obama.org/the-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>
